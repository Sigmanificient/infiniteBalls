# Infinite balls

Balls... everywhere.

## Description

A ball drop from the top of the screen. When it touches the bottom it bounches
back and an other ball is created. The balls are colored randomly.

It's a simple projet that I made to familiarize myself with the CSFML library
that we are using at Epitech.

This program can be used to test the performance of your computer :D
